# Reduction

Write a GPU program that performs parallel reduction on an array of 32-bit floating point numbers to compute their sum. The program should take an input array and produce a single output value containing the sum of all elements.

## Implementation Requirements
* Use only GPU native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` variable

## Example 1:
```
Input: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
Output: 36.0
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: [-2.5, 1.5, -1.0, 2.0]
Output: 0.0
```

## Constraints
* 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100,000,000
* -1000.0 ≤ `input[i]` ≤ 1000.0
* The final sum will always fit within a 32-bit float
