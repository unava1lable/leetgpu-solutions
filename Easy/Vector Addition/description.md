# Vector Addition

Implement a program that performs element-wise addition of two vectors containing 32-bit floating point numbers on a GPU. The program should take two input vectors of equal length and produce a single output vector containing their sum.

## Implementation Requirements
* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in vector `C`

## Example 1:
```
Input:  A = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
        B = [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
Output: C = [6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0]
```

## Example 2:
```
Input:  A = [1.5, 1.5, 1.5]
        B = [2.3, 2.3, 2.3]
Output: C = [3.8, 3.8, 3.8]
```

## Constraints
* Input vectors `A` and `B` have identical lengths
* 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100,000,000
