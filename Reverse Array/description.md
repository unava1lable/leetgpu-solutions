# Reverse Array

Implement a program that reverses an array of 32-bit floating point numbers in-place. The program should perform an in-place reversal of `input`.

## Implementation Requirements
* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored back in `input`

## Example 1:
```
Input: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
Output: [4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: [1.5, 2.5, 3.5]
Output: [3.5, 2.5, 1.5]
```

## Constraints
* 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100,000,000
