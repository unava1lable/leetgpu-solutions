# Matrix Copy

Implement a program that copies an $N \times N $ matrix of 32-bit floating point numbers from input array $A$ to output array $B$ on the GPU. The program should perform a direct element-wise copy so that $B_{i,j}=A_{i,j}$ for all valid indices.

## Implementation Requirements
* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in matrix `B`

## Example 1:
```
Input:  A = [[1.0, 2.0],
             [3.0, 4.0]]
Output: B = [[1.0, 2.0],
             [3.0, 4.0]]
```

## Example 2:
```
Input:  A = [[5.5, 6.6, 7.7],
             [8.8, 9.9, 10.1],
             [11.2, 12.3, 13.4]]
Output: B = [[5.5, 6.6, 7.7],
             [8.8, 9.9, 10.1],
             [11.2, 12.3, 13.4]]
```

## Constraints
* 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 4096
* All elements are 32-bit floating point numbers
