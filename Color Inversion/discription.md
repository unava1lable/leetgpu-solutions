# Color Inversion

Write a program to invert the colors of an image. The image is represented as a 1D array of RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) values, where each component is an 8-bit unsigned integer (`unsigned char`).

Color inversion is performed by subtracting each color component (R, G, B) from 255. The Alpha component should remain unchanged.

The input array `image` will contain `width * height * 4` elements. The first 4 elements represent the RGBA values of the top-left pixel, the next 4 elements represent the pixel to its right, and so on.

## Implementation Requirements
* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the array `image`

## Example 1:
```
Input: image = [255, 0, 128, 255, 0, 255, 0, 255], width=1, height=2
Output: [0, 255, 127, 255, 255, 0, 255, 255]
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: image = [10, 20, 30, 255, 100, 150, 200, 255], width=2, height=1
Output: [245, 235, 225, 255, 155, 105, 55, 255]
```

## Constraints
* 1 ≤ `width` ≤ 4096
* 1 ≤ `height` ≤ 4096
* `width * height` ≤ 8,388,608.
