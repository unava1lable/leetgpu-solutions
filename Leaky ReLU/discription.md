# Leaky ReLU

Implement a program that performs the leaky ReLU activation function on a vector of floating-point numbers. The leaky ReLU function is defined as:
$$
f(x)=\begin{cases}
x, & x>0\\
\alpha x, & x\le 0
\end{cases}
$$

where $\alpha$ is a small positive constant (0.01 in this problem).

## Implementation Requirements
* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in vector `output`
* Use $\alpha$ as the leaky coefficient

## Example 1:
```
  Input:  x = [1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0]
  Output: y = [1.0, -0.02, 3.0, -0.04]
```

## Example 2:
```
  Input:  x = [-1.5, 0.0, 2.5, -3.0]
  Output: y = [-0.015, 0.0, 2.5, -0.03]
```

## Constraints
* 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100,000,000
* -1000.0 ≤ `input[i]` ≤ 1000.0
