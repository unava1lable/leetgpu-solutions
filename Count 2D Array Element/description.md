# Count 2D Array Element

Write a GPU program that counts the number of elements with the integer value k in an 2D array of 32-bit integers. The program should count the number of elements with k in an 2D array. You are given an input 2D array `input` of length `N x M` and integer `k`.

## Implementation Requirements
* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The solve function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the output variable

## Example 1:
```
Input: input [[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 1]]
       k = 1
Output: output = 2
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: input [[5, 10],
              [5, 2]]
       k = 1
Output: output = 0
```

## Constraints
* 1 ≤ `N, M` ≤ 10,000
* 1 ≤ `input[i], k` ≤ 100
